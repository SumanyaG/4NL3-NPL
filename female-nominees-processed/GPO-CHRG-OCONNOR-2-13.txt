19 The CHAIRMAN. Senator East of North Carolina. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOHN P. EAST Senator EAST. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mrs. O'Connor, I welcome you this morning and congratulate you on your nomination. Senator Simpson is absolutely right in imply- ing that every Member of the Senate has somewhat of an envy of those who may be going on to the Supreme Court for that lifetime appointment. We live in that very imperfect and unsettled world of having to run for reelection, and grappling with high interest rates and related matters, so we do envy you down deep in our heart of hearts, no question about that. It is an honor, as a freshman Senator, to be a part of this very important process of confirming a Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court. This is a historic occasion, not only because you are the first woman nominee but because this, of course, represents the first great opportunity of this administration to change the general course and direction of the U.S. Supreme Court, one of the three great, vital institutions of the American system of government. Therefore, I look forward to being a part of this. I hope that our questions can be questions of substance and depth so that we can fulfill our constitutional obligation as a part of the confirmation process. Mr. Chairman, in the interest of time I would like the balance of my remarks to be entered into the record. The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, so ordered. Senator EAST. Again, my congratulations to you for your nomina- tion, and I welcome you here to the Senate Judiciary Committee this morning. [Material to be supplied follows:]
